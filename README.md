# Project Music Releases
In this project our assignment was to build a music realeases site using react.

# The problem
Main focus with this project was to learn how to break up JavaScript code into components, how to write JSX and how to use props to feed information to components. My approach was to plan ahead what components my site would consist of and divide problems into smaller tasks so I would not be overwhelmed as a beginner. Most used tool would probably be my browser, to be able to google answers to my questions ;)

As a stretch goal I focused on adding filter and search functionality. If I had more time, I would want to be able to use the Spotify Web API instead of static json files.
